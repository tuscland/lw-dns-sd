DNS Service Discovery for LispWorks


This library is a Common Lisp wrapper around the DNS-SD C API.

For an introduction to DNS Service Discovery:
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Networking/Conceptual/dns_discovery_api/Introduction.html

Using the DNS Service Discovery you will be able to:
- register, browse and resolve DNS-SD services,
- get IP addresses for host name in a portable way,
- create, query, update and remove DNS resource records,
- create NAT port mappings, or get the NAT's external IP address.

The library has been tested under the following implementations:
- LispWorks Professional 32 bits for Mac OS X,
- LispWorks Professional 32 bits for Windows,
- LispWorks Enterprise 64 bits for Mac OS X.

The C API Reference can be found here:
